My report on host 192.168.240.1 identifies a high-severity vulnerability: untrusted SSL/TLS certificates on ports 443/60443 and 8834. The self-signed and private CA certificates break the chain of trust, making the host susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. The fix is to replace them with certificates from a publicly trusted CA 

Vulnerability Report: Untrusted SSL/TLS Certificates
Host: 192.168.240.1

Vulnerability Analysis

The report indicates that two services on host 192.168.240.1 have untrusted SSL/TLS certificates. A security report typically classifies this as a high-severity vulnerability because it breaks the "chain of trust" and allows for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
• Port 443/60443: The certificate is self-signed, as the Subject (CN=laptop-pkep2uja) and the Issuer are identical. Self-signed certificates are not issued by a recognized Certificate Authority (CA) and are therefore not trusted by default in web browsers and operating systems.
• Port 8834: The certificate is issued by a private CA (CN=Nessus Certification Authority). While this CA might be trusted within a specific local network, it is not a public CA, so anyone outside that network would not trust the certificate.
In both cases, a browser would display a security warning, making it easy for an attacker to impersonate the service and intercept data.

Simple Fixes and Mitigations

The primary solution is to replace the untrusted certificates with ones from a publicly trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
• Obtain a Trusted Certificate: The server owner can purchase a certificate from a commercial CA like DigiCert or Sectigo, or get a free one from Let's Encrypt. For public-facing servers, Let's Encrypt is an excellent option because its certificates are widely trusted and can be renewed automatically.
• Install the Full Chain: When installing the new certificate, all intermediate certificates provided by the CA must also be installed. This creates a complete "chain of trust" from the server's certificate all the way back to a root CA that is already trusted by browsers.
• For the Nessus Service (Port 8834): Since this is often a local management interface, accepting the security risk in a controlled browser environment is an option. For a production environment, the Nessus documentation should be followed to install a custom certificate from a trusted CA.

Documenting the Critical Vulnerability

Vulnerability: Untrusted X.509 Certificate Chain
Severity: High

Description: The host 192.168.240.1 is using untrusted SSL/TLS certificates on services running on ports 443/60443 and 8834. The certificate for the main web service is self-signed, and the one for the Nessus interface is signed by an unknown internal CA. This lack of a trusted chain makes the services susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Recommended Actions:

1. For the public-facing service on port 443/60443, replace the self-signed certificate with one from a publicly trusted CA (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
2. For the Nessus service on port 8834, either acknowledge the security warning in a controlled environment or replace the certificate with one from a trusted CA if the service is publicly accessible.
